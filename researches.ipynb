It varies from person to person. Some people dedicate their lives to love, family, or serving others. Some find happiness, success, or intellectual growth. But in reality, the meaning of life is what we find in our own lives.\")\\n\\nOther possible responses in Urdu could be:\\n\\n* \"زندگی کا معنی اپنی خواہشات کو پورا کرنا ہے\" (The meaning of life is to fulfill one\\'s desires)\\n* \"زندگی کا معنی اپنے مقصد کو پورا کرنا ہے\" (The meaning of life is to achieve one\\'s purpose)\\n* \"زندگی کا معنی خود کو پانا ہے\" (The meaning of life is to find oneself)\\n\\nAnd so on.
